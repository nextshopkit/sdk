## ⚡️ Why @nextshopkit/sdk?

Building a headless storefront with Shopify’s Storefront API can be challenging — repetitive GraphQL queries, vague errors, and lots of boilerplate.

`@nextshopkit/sdk` solves that with:

- ✅ Prebuilt typed functions (e.g. `getProduct`, `getProducts`)
- 🧠 Metafield parsing and transformation
- 🛒 Cart operations out of the box
- 🔐 Server-only logic, safe by default
- 🧩 Optional PRO features like metaobjects, blogs, search (coming soon)

Whether you're building a small shop or scaling a full e-commerce platform — this SDK helps you **move faster with confidence**.

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install @nextshopkit/sdk
# or
yarn add @nextshopkit/sdk
```

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-storefront-access-token
SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=your-shop.myshopify.com
```

> These credentials are used securely on the server only. Never expose them to the client.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Create a Shopify client:

```ts
import { createShopifyClient } from "@nextshopkit/sdk";

const client = createShopifyClient({
  shop: process.env.SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN!,
  token: process.env.SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN!,
  apiVersion: "2025-01",
});
```

Fetch a product:

```ts
const { data, error } = await client.getProduct({
  handle: "my-product-handle",
});

if (error || !data) {
  throw new Error("Product not found");
}

console.log(data.title, data.price.amount);
```
